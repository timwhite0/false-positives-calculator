# false-positives-calculator

The [False Positives Calculator](falsepositives.shinyapps.io/calculator) is a Shiny dashboard about the cumulative risk of false positives in screening tests for cancers and STDs. It is a complementary tool for a forthcoming paper entitled "Estimating the lifetime risk of a false positive screening test result," which was written by Tim White and Dr. Sara Algeri at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities.

Here you'll find the code used to create the Shiny dashboard (see app.R), as well as the data files.
